          <h1>History about Uganda Rolex</h1>
          <p>
            Rolex is a popular food item in Uganda, combining an egg omelette
            and veggies wrapped in a chapati.[1] This single-portion dish is
            quick to prepare, and can be eaten at any time of the day, from
            breakfast to a lunch or supper meal or snack. The name "rolex" comes
            from its method of preparation, with the chapati and the omelette
            rolled together ("rolled eggs"). This idea originated from a chapati
            seller's creativity in the Busoga region "the basoga" then the idea
            spread to Wandegeya next to Makerere University in Uganda, fueled by
            students who needed a quick meal because of time and budget
            limitations.[3][4] A "Rolex" merchant frying chapatis A "Rolex"

              Uganda’s “Rolex” is breakfast luxury that can be purchased on any
              street corner. Whipped egg is the gold setting. Precious studs of
              tomato and purple onion glitter across the surface like garnet and
              amethyst, while fine strands of cabbage sparkle like peridot. The
              completed jewel is nestled safely in a soft chapati wrap.

              Rolex is classic Ugandan street food. The similarity to the luxury
              watch brand is happenstance: Once upon a time the vendors who made
              this treat called out “Rolled Eggs” – nothing more. The basic idea
              is eggs cooked with cabbage, onion, tomato, and sometimes peppers,
              which is then wrapped in chapati. But, as the words careened off
              their tongue, “Rolled Eggs” sounded more like “Rolex” to visitors.
              Gradually the (quite fun) misinterpretation stuck.
